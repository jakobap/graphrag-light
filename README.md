# graphrag-light

Welcome to graphrag-light. An easy to start, GCP native, graphrag implementation. 

The implementation depends on [graph2nosql](https://github.com/jakobap/graph2nosql), a simple python interface to store and manage knowledge graphs in your NoSQL DB of choice (*no* graphdb needed, you heard correctly!).
